# Hand Me Up
http://www.handme-up.com

The fight to reduce food wastage and combat world hunger starts with you.

Our **mobile app** aims to organize motivated volunteers to deliver food that would otherwise be wasted by markets and restaurants to local shelters and food pantries. It's easy to sign-up, find an open delivery, and serve your community. Our **web app** aims to connect food markets and restaurants with the local food pantrys to display the foods available and establish deliveries that users of the app can view.

## How it's built
Our team used the Apache [Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/) framework for web-based mobile applications. Using a basic [template](http://market.ionic.io/starters/event-app-and-maps) from the [Ionic Framework](http://ionicframework.com/), and several APIs such as google-maps to make a simple, feature rich app for volunteers.
